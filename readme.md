# Citibike Customer behaviour

## The problem

I am always a big fan of the shared economy. In this project, I am going to explore the customer behaviour pattern of the citibike users.

## The solution

I used the 2017-07 citibike open-sourced users data to tackle this project.

I first explored the demographic information of the users and found the male to female ratio is around 3:1, the main age group of users is from 30-50 and the subscriber to customer ratio is around 17.65%.

I then investigated the hottest location in NYC people like to share the bikes on Google Map App and user data.  It turned out to be the most popular location is 1 Ave & E 16 St on Manhattan island.

I was also curious about the change of usage pattern in a day and people's average riding speed in new york city. I also answered these questions in my data analysis.
